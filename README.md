## About the work
### Background
The urbanization process associated with the increase in world population involves a range of undesired consequences. Overcrowded and dense cities often lack green spaces and are totally dependent on agricultural production and its corresponding logistics. As a result, cities are depleting resources and nutrients from agricultural soils, generating a vast amount of underexploited agri-food residues. Urban agriculture is often considered an opportunity to alleviate some of these issues, with productive rooftops offering a promising solution by combining food production with recycling organic waste and providing green spaces without consuming urban soils. In addition, harnessing natural resources, including plant-associated microbiomes, is proposed as an effective approach to sustainably improve farm productivity and food quality, promoting positive environmental and social outcomes. In this context, microbes inhabiting different compost and biochar-compost substrates have received less attention than their differences on physicochemical properties, but both aspects are important for better understanding the interactions between substrates and plants.
### Results
Here, we explored the effects of feedstock materials (spent coffee grounds, coffee silverskin and seaweed biomass) and biochar-blending with compost on horticultural substrate properties, microbial communities, and tomato production. Substrate properties were mainly defined by the feedstocks composted, but adding biochar during composting enhanced the quality of the end-products. Overall, alternative substrates differed from peat mainly by presenting higher P content, pH and electric conductivity (EC). Concerning microbial communities, biochar blending was also less relevant than the organic feedstocks. Even though alternative substrates presented higher bacterial diversity than peat, the fact that peat communities dominate taxonomic composition reflect the functional redundancy of the bacterial communities. In addition, we identified specific communities associated with each feedstock, being the ones associated with composted seaweed biomass positively and significantly correlated with tomato yield.
### Conclusions
The studied substrates influenced tomato growth and yield directly via their chemical and physical properties and by influencing microbial community composition. Together, our results reveal the importance of using the appropriate organic substrate for enhancing the effectiveness of rooftop agriculture while increasing microbial diversity in urban unexploited areas.
