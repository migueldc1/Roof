## About the work
### Background
The urbanization process associated with the increase in world population involves a range of undesired consequences. Urban agriculture is often considered an opportunity to alleviate some of these issues, with productive rooftops emerging as a promising solution. In addition, harnessing natural resources, including plant-associated microbiomes, is proposed as an effective approach to sustainably improve farm productivity and food quality, promoting positive environmental and social outcomes. In this context, the microbes dwelling different compost and biochar-compost substrates have received less attention than its differences on physicochemical properties, but both aspects are important for better understanding the interactions between substrates and plants. 
### Results
Here, we explored the effects of feedstock material (spent coffee grounds, coffee silverskin and algal waste) and biochar-blending with compost on substrate properties, microbial communities, and tomato production. Substrate properties were mainly defined by the feedstocks, but adding biochar-blending during composting enhanced the quality of the end products. Concerning microbial communities, biochar application was less relevant, as most of microbial community variance was explained by organic feedstocks. In addition, we identified specific communities associated to each feedstock, being the ones associated with composted algal waste positively and significantly correlated with tomato yield.
### Conclusions
Organic substrates influenced tomato growth and yield directly via substrate properties and by influencing microbial community composition. Together, our results reveal the importance of using the appropriate organic substrate for enhancing the effectiveness of rooftop agriculture.
